      <!-- The Problem We Solve -->
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">Why We Exist</h3>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 mb-6">
        In many communities, students face a lack of accessible, reliable information about schools, scholarships, or career pathways. As a result, important decisions — like which major to choose, which school to attend, or what career to pursue — are often made blindly. <strong>Education Hub exists to fix that.</strong>
