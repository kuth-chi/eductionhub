Demonstration of Ad Storage Cleanup System

This script shows how the implemented file cleanup system works
for handling ad poster images when ads are updated or deleted.

✅ IMPLEMENTED COMPONENTS:

1. 📝 Enhanced Signals (ads/signals.py):
   • automatic file deletion when ads are deleted
   • cleanup of old files when poster is changed
   • safe file deletion with error handling

2. 🛠️ Storage Utilities (ads/utils/storage_cleanup.py):
   • scan_storage_files() - find all poster files
   • get_referenced_poster_files() - find files still in use
   • find_orphaned_files() - identify unused files
   • cleanup_orphaned_files() - remove orphaned files
   • validate_database_file_integrity() - check for missing files
   • calculate_storage_size() - storage statistics

3. ⚙️ Management Command (ads/management/commands/cleanup_ad_storage.py):
   • python manage.py cleanup_ad_storage --dry-run
   • python manage.py cleanup_ad_storage --confirm
   • python manage.py cleanup_ad_storage --report
   • python manage.py cleanup_ad_storage --integrity-check

🔧 HOW IT WORKS:

1. When an Ad is Updated:
   └── pre_save signal detects poster change
   └── old poster file is automatically deleted
   └── new poster file replaces it

2. When an Ad is Deleted:
   └── post_delete signal triggers
   └── associated poster file is automatically deleted
   └── storage space is freed immediately

3. For Maintenance:
   └── run management command to find orphaned files
   └── clean up files that lost their database references
   └── generate reports on storage usage

🎯 KEY FEATURES:

• Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat
• Safe deletion with error handling
• Dry-run mode for testing
• Comprehensive reporting
• Database integrity checking
• Storage usage statistics

🚀 USAGE EXAMPLES:

Backend (Django):
```python
# When updating an ad with new poster
ad = AdManager.objects.get(uuid=some_uuid)
ad.poster = new_image_file  # Old file automatically deleted
ad.save()

# When deleting an ad
ad.delete()  # Poster file automatically deleted
```

Management Commands:
```bash
# Preview what would be cleaned
python manage.py cleanup_ad_storage --dry-run

# Actually clean up orphaned files
python manage.py cleanup_ad_storage --confirm

# Generate storage report
python manage.py cleanup_ad_storage --report
```

📊 BENEFITS:

1. ✅ No manual file management needed
2. ✅ Prevents storage space waste
3. ✅ Automatic cleanup on ad changes
4. ✅ Tools for maintenance and monitoring
5. ✅ Safe operations with error handling
6. ✅ Detailed logging and reporting

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

• Files are permanently deleted - backup important data
• Use --dry-run first to preview changes
• Regular maintenance with management commands recommended
• Database integrity checks help identify issues
