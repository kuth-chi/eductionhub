# Education Attachments - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully implemented **optional attachment uploads** for Education entries in the Resume Builder. Users can now add attachments (certificates, transcripts, documents) either during education creation OR after by editing the entry.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Backend (Already Supported)

The backend was already fully configured to handle optional attachments:

**Model:** `user/models/base.py`
```python
class Attachment(models.Model):
    file = models.FileField(upload_to="attachments/", verbose_name=_("file"))
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    uploaded_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    content_type = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)

class Education(models.Model):
    # ... other fields ...
    attachments = models.ManyToManyField(
        "Attachment", 
        blank=True,  # ✅ Optional
        verbose_name=_("attachments")
    )
```

**Serializer:** `api/serializers/user/resume.py`
```python
class EducationSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    attachments = AttachmentSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)
    attachment_ids = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(
        many=True,
        write_only=True,
        queryset=Attachment.objects.all(),
        source="attachments",
        required=False,  # ✅ Optional
    )
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/user-attachments/` - Create attachment (upload file)
- `GET /api/v1/user-attachments/` - List user attachments
- `POST /api/v1/resume/education/` - Create education with optional `attachment_ids`
- `PATCH /api/v1/resume/education/{id}/` - Update education, add/remove attachments

### ✅ Frontend Implementation

#### 1. File Upload Service

**File:** `src/lib/file-upload.ts`

Added two new methods to `FileUploadService`:

```typescript
// Upload a single attachment
async uploadAttachment(file: File): Promise<AttachmentUploadResponse>

// Upload multiple attachments, returns array of IDs
async uploadAttachments(files: File[]): Promise<number[]>
```

**Features:**
- Uploads files to `/api/v1/user-attachments/`
- Returns attachment ID for linking to education
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Supports multiple file uploads

#### 2. Education Form Component

**File:** `src/modules/resume/ui/components/education-form.tsx`

**New State Management:**
```typescript
const [selectedFiles, setSelectedFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);
const [uploadedAttachmentIds, setUploadedAttachmentIds] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
const [uploadError, setUploadError] = useState<string | null>(null);
const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
```

**New Handlers:**
```typescript
// Handle file selection and upload
const handleFileSelect = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  // Upload files immediately when selected
  const ids = await FileUploadService.uploadAttachments(fileArray);
  setUploadedAttachmentIds((prev) => [...prev, ...ids]);
}

// Remove uploaded file
const handleRemoveFile = (index: number) => {
  // Remove from local state
}

// Enhanced submit with attachment IDs
const handleFormSubmit = async (data: EducationInput) => {
  const submitData: EducationInput = {
    ...data,
    attachment_ids: uploadedAttachmentIds.length > 0 ? uploadedAttachmentIds : undefined,
  };
  await onSubmit(submitData);
};
```

**New UI Elements:**
1. **Upload Button:** Triggers hidden file input
2. **File Input:** Hidden, supports multiple files, accepts `.pdf, .doc, .docx, .jpg, .jpeg, .png`
3. **File List:** Shows uploaded files with name, size, and remove button
4. **Existing Attachments:** Shows current attachments when editing
5. **Upload Progress:** "Uploading..." state indicator
6. **Error Display:** Shows upload errors to user

**UI Preview:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Attachments (Optional)                [Add Files]│
│ Upload certificates, transcripts, or documents   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📄 certificate.pdf (124.5 KB)             [×]   │
│ 📄 transcript.pdf (89.2 KB)               [×]   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Current Attachments:                             │
│ 📄 degree-certificate.pdf                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 3. Validation Schema

**File:** `src/modules/resume/schemas.ts`

```typescript
export const educationInputSchema = z.object({
  // ... other fields ...
  attachment_ids: z.array(z.number()).optional(),  // ✅ Already optional
});
```
