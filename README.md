# EductationHub (Cambodia School & Scholarship Directory)

- Education Level (Primary, Secondary, etc.)
- Public or Private
- Geographic Location (Latitude & Longitude)

- Additional School Details

### 🎓 Scholarships:
We also gather and share information about available scholarships to help students find the right opportunities for their education.
